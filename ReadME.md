#MOVIE THEATER
create an application that allows a user to buy movie tickets from the theater

#Core Deliverables
1. A user should see the first movie details when the page loads. i.e. the poster,showtime,runtime.The number of
   available tickets will need to be derived by subtracting the number of `tickets_sold` from the theater's `capacity`
   
2. See a list of all the movies on the left side of the page.
3. A user should be able to buy tickets for a movie. if there are no more tickets the user should see that the movie is sold out.
